### Hi there 👋
<h1> Welcome to my GitHub 👨‍💻❤️ </h1>
<p>
  I am James Nyaundi, I started out as a cool guy i.e Hacker, then transitioned to DevOps(Cool stuffs by the way) and I am passionate with Frontend Design. <br>  I am passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy learning and working with Javascript and its frameworks like React and NodeJs. I dream in Javascript, and I always think that CSS is better than Tailwind.
